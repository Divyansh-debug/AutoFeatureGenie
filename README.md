## 🚀 Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Generates detailed summaries of datasets, including column statistics and target identification.  
  - Provides insights into data distribution, missing values, and key metrics for numeric columns.  

- **AI-Powered Feature Suggestions:**  
  - Uses Google's Gemini Generative AI to generate context-aware feature suggestions.  
  - Supports domain-specific prompts for tailored feature engineering.  

- **Integration-Ready:**  
  - Designed to integrate seamlessly with data pipelines and machine learning workflows.  
  - Outputs feature suggestions in JSON format for easy consumption by downstream processes.
